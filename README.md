## The 10 key SCRUM terms
### SCRUM Master
  * The SCRUM Master is a role in the SCRUM that a member of the group takes up and their role is to guide the group in the right direction through helping them and informing them on their stories. 
  
### Sprint
  * A Sprint is a period of time that contains the SCRUM events and activities. these Sprints are contained for a number of days until they end.
  
### SCRUM
  * The SCRUM itself is a method of completing complex tasks in groups of two or more. the SCRUM uses group activities and events to divide the task into manageable sizes for each team member to handle.
  
### Sprint planning
  * Sprint planning is where the team will plan to create a Sprint by creating the Sprint Backlog
  
### Ready
  * This is a sheared understanding among the group that 
  
### Increment
  * Increment is when a piece of software adds to another increment or more, to create a product.
  
### SCRUM Board
  * SCRUM Board is a board containing information in the form of visual information for the team to use to understand their tasks and objectives.
  
### SCRUM values
  * SCRUM Values Are Values that make up the SCRUM frame work; commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage.
  
### Definition of Done
  * A shared understanding of expectations that the Increment must live up to in order to be releasable into production. Managed by the Development Team.
  
###Increment
  * A piece of working software that adds to previously created Increments, where the sum of all Increments, as a whole, form a product.
###Debugging
  * debugging is when the creator of the program (or another programmer) will search for bugs (errors) in the application in order to     seek them out and fix them or remove them. Debugging can be commonly seen when code is run is most IDE. For example, when code I run which does not work. The IDE will output which line the code stopped working to allow the user to find the error easier.
  
### Algorithm
  * A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer. An algorithm and big part of building an application. The algorithm could be a complex calculation that is creating in a visual example such as a flowchart, which makes the algorithm easy to understand by following the flowchart. This flowchart is then used as a base for creating the algorithm in the code for the application.
  
### Process of building an application using algorithm
  * When building an application most of the time an algorithm is used to design and plan the application before creating it. The algorithm can come in any forms however one good example of a algorithm used during development and planning would be a flowchart. The flowchart shows a visual example of what the application should do and how it "flows".
  
### Procedural
  * Relating to an established or official way of doing something.
  
### Object oriented
  * Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

### Event-driven
  * Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses).
