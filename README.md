## The 10 key SCRUM terms
### SCRUM Master
  * The SCRUM Master is a role in the SCRUM that a member of the group takes up and their role is to guide the group in the right direction through helping them and informing them on their stories. 
  
### Sprint
  * A Sprint is a period of time that contains the SCRUM events and activities. these Sprints are contained for a number of days until they end.
  
### SCRUM
  * The SCRUM itself is a method of completing complex tasks in groups of two or more. the SCRUM uses group activities and events to divide the task into manageable sizes for each team member to handle.
  
### Sprint planning
  * Sprint planning is where the team will plan to create a Sprint by creating the Sprint Backlog
  
### Ready
  * This is a sheared understanding among the group that 
  
### Increment
  * Increment is when a piece of software adds to another increment or more, to create a product.
  
### SCRUM Board
  * SCRUM Board is a board containing information in the form of visual information for the team to use to understand their tasks and objectives.
  
### SCRUM values
  * SCRUM Values Are Values that make up the SCRUM frame work; commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage.
  
### Definition of Done
  * A shared understanding of expectations that the Increment must live up to in order to be releasable into production. Managed by the Development Team.
  
### Increment
  * A piece of working software that adds to previously created Increments, where the sum of all Increments, as a whole, form a product.
### Debugging
  * debugging is when the creator of the program (or another programmer) will search for bugs (errors) in the application in order to     seek them out and fix them or remove them. Debugging can be commonly seen when code is run is most IDE. For example, when code I run which does not work. The IDE will output which line the code stopped working to allow the user to find the error easier.
  
### Algorithm
  * A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer. An algorithm and big part of building an application. The algorithm could be a complex calculation that is creating in a visual example such as a flowchart, which makes the algorithm easy to understand by following the flowchart. This flowchart is then used as a base for creating the algorithm in the code for the application.
  
### Process of building an application using algorithm
  * When building an application most of the time an algorithm is used to design and plan the application before creating it. The algorithm can come in any forms however one good example of an algorithm used during development and planning would be a flowchart. The flowchart shows a visual example of what the application should do and how it "flows".
#### the process of building an application can be simplified into six easy steps:

Step 1. Meeting The Client

Before any work can be done the first step is to meet with the client and discus the plan for the application. These include deadlines and the design for the application.

step 2. Work out the requirements for the application

after meeting with the client and discussing the application you need to figure out what the application will do and how it will work to best suits the clients wants and needs.

Step 3. Design

Now you can focus on making a design of the application. This will involve how to looks, feel and works with the user and the clientâ€™s needs. 

Step 4. Development

Development is where you make your app. In the development stage any mistakes that arise could be very costly, both in terms of time and money, so having a clear plan and design beforehand is critical.

Step 5. Testing

Testing is important during the last stages of the development process to make sure that the application works as intended and to remove any bugs or errors found in the application before it is sent to the client.

step 6. Support

The next step if gathering the support needed to keep the application up and running when the application is delivered to the client.

Step 7. Deliver to the Client

The last step is to deliver the application to the client.
  
### Procedural
  * procedural is a type of programming style that involves the concept of procedures. Which is a sequence of commands that that will be executed.
  
### Object oriented
  * Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

### Event-driven
  * Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses).
  
 ### Written code to execution
  * There are many steps taken for written code to be executed into a working program. One of these steps is to design the code first before creating it. This is to make sure that the application will work as an idea before it is created. These can be done through flowcharts and design briefs that explain what the application will be and how it will be created.
  * The next step is to create the code for the application. This involves a lot of trial and error before the code is fully complete. commenting and using coding standards can make the code easier to understand in the future. Once the code is complete with no errors, then the finale step can be achieved which is the execution of the code which will produce the final version of the application.

### Feasibility report
A feasibility report is a document that assesses potential solutions to the business problem or opportunity, and determines which of these are viable for further analysis. The main purpose of a feasibility report is to know the different factors that go into a business venture and see how it will work on the open market and the target audience.

A Feasibility report will contain the following:

#### Proposed Project Description
This segment is for essentially describing the project that is being worked on and goes into detail about the time constraints and how much the project will cost, not only money but in terms of manpower too. This section will vary depending on the size of the team involve in the development of the applciation.

#### Market Analysis Section
This section looks at the market that the current project will be targeted at. Detailing the size of the market and its demographic using available data or by completing surveys. This is done to determine if a venture into this market will be profitable.

#### Technical Feasibility Section
Technical Feasibility covers the ability to complete the programming and other technical challenges. This will involve the techincal challenges and problems that will get in the way when developing the application. The Technical Feasibility Section will list those problems so that they can be solved later on or avoided later on in development.

#### Financial Feasibility Section
The Financial Feasibility section talks about any costs that come with the project and if the venture is profitable, this can include costs of software, staff payments and bills.

### Addressing user requirments using epics, stories, versions, and sprints
The original users and system requirements were reviewed and combined into a series of epics which were in turn broken down into user stories. The user stories were used during the sprints as part of the development process. At the end of each sprint demonstrable software or designs were made available to the client and the team for testing and review. An example of a user story being reviewed would be a user story from the ZSL project which would say "Add Educational Content into the ZSL project". This story will go through the client and they will see if these story meet their requirement. this story when completed will builder up to an epic which would be the main objective of the project which will be main gameplay elements and features of the application. These stories are completed in sprints. these then go through testing and reviewing. This is then repeated until the client is happy with the outcome.

The image above is in what order the epics, stories, versions and sprints go.

### Reviewing user stories
user stories that are made during a projects starting phase may have to be reviewed later on to make sure that they align with the clients and the developers needs for the finished project. The stories are arranged in order of importance and are arranged into epics. These epics can then be broken down into stories which will make them easier to do. These are then put through testing and reviewing to make sure that they are up to the client or developers standards. This process is repeated until the end of the project and the application is finished.

### Continuing Professional Development (CPD)
the process of tracking and documenting the skills, knowledge and experience that you gain both formally and informally as you work, beyond any initial training. It's a record of what you experience, learn and then apply.
#### Why is this important
CPD is important because it keeps the same level of professional standard during a project or any other work. This keeps work in a neat layout and easy to read for any other user as well as keep a style that the user can use.
